# Get Started

Clone and `cd` to the repo, then get dependencies:

- With `pipenv`:
```bash
$ pipenv install
```

- With `pip` (in an activated virtual environment):
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To open the java gateway, run:
```bash
$ java -jar dl4python-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
and the gateway will be open as long as the terminal is running.

In your activated virtual environment, try:
```bash
$ python3 main.py dutch-pancakes.owx ForestDish
```

or just 
```bash
$ ./main.py dutch-pancakes.owx ForestDish
```
